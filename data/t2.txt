CASE
SUMMARY
:
A
92-year
old
white
woman
who
was
receiving
venlafaxine
for
management
of
depression
was
found
to
have
hyponatremia

Touch
sensibility
was
assessed
with
von
Frey
's
monofilaments
in
the
breasts
of
10
healthy
women
(
controls
)
and
of
80
women
with
breast
cancer
who
at
least
1
year
previously
had
undergone
subcutaneous
mastectomy
and
immediate
reconstruction
with
a
prosthesis

Although
improved
glycemic
control
,
maintenance
of
normal
blood
pressure
,
and
use
of
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitors
are
important
strategies
to
avoid
developing
microalbuminuria
,
dietary
macronutrient
intake
may
also
play
a
role

Local
injection
of
corticosteroids
into
refractory
esophageal
strictures
to
decrease
the
restenosis
rate
has
been
reported

We
systematically
reviewed
the
evidence
concerning
the
ability
of
five
systemic
treatments
to
induce
remission
in
patients
with
severe
psoriasis
:
ultraviolet
B
(
UVB
)
,
photochemotherapy
(
PUVA
)
,
methotrexate
(
MTX
)
,
retinoids
(
RET
)
and
cyclosporin
A
(
CYA
)

Consequently
,
parenteral
nutrition
(
PN
)
solutions
used
to
treat
malnourished
patients
with
chronic
renal
failure
usually
are
prepared
with
little
supplementation
of
these
cations

CONCLUSIONS
:
Malnourished
patients
with
chronic
renal
failure
receiving
PN
are
at
risk
of
developing
electrolyte
abnormalities
,
particularly
hypophosphatemia

PURPOSE
:
We
report
a
multicenter
experience
using
tubularized
incised
plate
urethroplastym
for
proximal
hypospadias

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
From
August
1993
to
December
1996
tubularized
incised
plate
urethroplasty
was
performed
in
27
boys
6
months
to
3
years
old
with
mid
shaft
and
penoscrotal
hypospadias

RESULTS
:
Tubularized
incised
plate
surgery
created
a
functional
neourethra
even
in
penoscrotal
hypospadias

CONCLUSIONS
:
Tubularized
incised
plate
urethroplasty
is
a
versatile
operation
that
corrects
proximal
hypospadias
defects
with
few
complications
and
superior
cosmetic
results

We
describe
such
an
event

Olanzapine
is
an
atypical
antipsychotic
effective
in
the
treatment
of
schizophrenic
patients

After
a
2-
to
9-day
placebo
lead-in
,
79
inpatients
with
schizophrenia
according
to
DSM-III-R
criteria
were
placed
on
an
olanzapine
dosage
of
10
mg/day
or
1
mg/day
for
up
to
6
weeks

Fludarabine
and
ara-C
successfully
eradicated
bone
marrow
disease
in
16
of
27
patients
(
59
%
)
,
23
patients
of
which
had
been
treated
previously
with
high-dose
ara-C

These
results
verified
the
synergistic
effect
fludarabine
exhibited
in
augmenting
ara-CTP
concentrations
in
patients
'
leukemic
blasts
,
thus
improving
the
clinical
response
in
relapsed
pediatric
leukemias

BACKGROUND
:
The
growing
use
of
heparin
in
acute
thrombotic
disorders
,
coupled
with
the
availability
of
many
new
antithrombotic
agents
,
emphasizes
the
need
for
adequate
characterization
of
the
platelet
effects
of
the
various
anticoagulants

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
Platelet
P-selectin
(
CD62
)
and
activated
GP
IIb/IIIa
(
PAC-1
)
expression
on
platelet
membrane
was
quantified
in
whole
blood
as
well
as
platelet
aggregation
in
platelet-rich
plasma
in
43
patients
with
unstable
angina
before
and
during
treatment
with
UFH
or
enoxaparin

PURPOSE
:
We
review
our
initial
experience
with
direct
percutaneous
transluminal
angioplasty
(
PTA
)
as
a
reperfusion
treatment
for
acute
occlusion
of
the
middle
cerebral
artery

<
TO_SEE

CONCLUSION
:
Direct
PTA
may
be
performed
safely
as
an
alternative
to
thrombolytic
therapy
in
patients
with
acute
occlusion
of
the
middle
cerebral
artery
when
early
CT
findings
and/or
lenticulostriate
artery
involvement
are
present
or
when
superselective
local
angiography
shows
the
presence
of
a
large
embolus
or
high-grade
stenosis

Women
randomised
to
screen-and-treat
received
appropriate
antibiotics
only
if
screening
proved
positive
for
one
or
more
infection

<

A
71-year-old
woman
with
autoimmune
hemolytic
anemia
underwent
an
emergency
endocardial
patch
repair
for
ventricular
septal
perforation
after
acute
myocardial
infarction

Use
of
washed
red
blood
cells
was
effective
in
averting
hemolytic
crisis
throughout
perioperative
period

Therefore
,
prudent
management
and
use
of
washed
red
blood
cells
transfusion
would
prevent
hemolytic
aggravation
even
in
open
heart
surgery

We
report
a
case
of
a
29-year-old
male
chronic
HBV
carrier
who
developed
fulminant
reactivated
HBV
infection
following
intensive
chemotherapy
for
stage
IVB
large
cell
B-cell
non-Hodgkin

lymphoma
associated
with
extensive
central
nervous
system
and
bone
marrow
involvement

We
advise
that
lamivudine
should
be
considered
during
intensive
chemotherapy
treatment
of
chronic
carriers
of
HBV

OBJECTIVES
:
The
purpose
of
this
analysis
was
to
determine
the
influence
of
an
additional
treatment
delay
inherent
in
transfer
to
an
angioplasty
center
for
primary
angioplasty
of
patients
with
acute
myocardial
infarction
who
are
first
admitted
to
hospitals
without
angioplasty
facilities

BACKGROUND
:
Several
randomized
trials
have
demonstrated
the
benefits
of
primary
angioplasty
in
acute
myocardial
infarction

We
report
the
first
case
(
to
our
knowledge
)
of
an
endoscopic
removal
of
a
forehead
soft
tissue
mass

As
the
overview
shows
,
both
groups
of
substances
are
useful
for
individualized
treatment
of
benign
prostatic
hyperplasia
(
BPH
)
,
provided
that
conservative
pharmacological
treatment
of
BPH
is
basically
accepted
and
that
the
patients
'
quality
of
life
is
also
considered

The
results
of
several
clinical
investigations
showed
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
artichoke
extracts
(
Cynara
scolymus
L.
)
in
the
treatment
of
hepato-biliary
dysfunction
and
digestive
complaints
,
such
as
sensation
of
fullness
,
loss
of
appetite
,
nausea
and
abdominal
pain

Besides
the
well-known
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
(
NSAID
)
for
the
treatment
of
rheumatic
pain
herbal
medicine
can
also
be
applied
successfully

Extracts
of
the
secondary
tubers
of
Devil
's
Claw
(
Harpagophytum
procumbens
)
are
recommended
for
the
supportive
treatment
of
degenerative
painful
rheumatism

High-dose
intravenous
immunoglobulin
(
hdIVIg
)
is
increasingly
used
to
treat
a
range
of
inflammatory
and
autoimmune
diseases

The
current
dermatological
uses
of
hdIVIg
include
the
treatment
of
dermatomyositis
and
the
autoimmune
bullous
disorders
,
epidermolysis
bullosa
acquisita
,
pemphigoid
,
and
pemphigus

Unfortunately
,
current
dermatological
uses
of
hdIVIg
have
been
limited
to
either
uncontrolled
trials
or
anecdotal
case
reports
,
except
for
a
single
controlled
trial
of
hdIVIg
as
adjunctive
therapy
in
patients
with
dermatomyositis
,
which
documented
a
significant
benefit

We
describe
a
technique
that
enables
the
autologous
repair
of
large
midline
incisional
hernias
by
restoring
the
functional
musculoaponeurotic
support
of
the
abdominal
wall

OBJECTIVE
AND
IMPORTANCE
:
The
use
of
chronic
intrathecal
morphine
for
the
treatment
of
intractable
,
nonmalignant
pain
is
becoming
more
prevalent

METHODS
:
During
a
19-month
period
,
seven
children
with
empyema
underwent
thoracoscopy

We
describe
a
patient
with
left
cardiac
herniation
presenting

cancer

The
growing
use
of
automated
night-time
dialysis
(
APD
)
in
peritoneal
dialysis
over
the
last
few
years
shows
that
this
method
represents
a
valid
alternative
to
continuous
ambulatory
peritoneal
dialysis
(
CAPD
)

La
Serna
et
al
.
(
Lancet
1987
;
26
:
1517
)
were
the
first
to
treat
adults
with
recurrent
pericarditis
with
colchicine
,
and
were
followed
by
other
authors

While
these
findings
are
observed
for
all
classes
of
oral
drugs
,
the
issue
is
especially
critical
for
cancer
chemotherapy
,
in
which
a
narrow
therapeutic
index
is
frequently
observed

Treatment
for
low-grade
NHL
during
the
past
30
yr
has
consisted
of
high-dose
radiation
and
cytotoxic
agents
,
administered
alone
or
in
combination
,
and
high-dose
therapy
with
stem
cell
transplant

However
,
recent
clinical
use
of
monoclonal
antibodies
(
mAbs
)
in
patients
with
low-grade
or
transformed
low-grade
NHL
has
resulted
in
less
toxicity
than
conventional
treatments
,
as
well
as
response
rates
that
are
comparable
or
superior
to
those
achieved
with
chemotherapy

Therefore
,
interest
is
growing
in
mAbs
as
therapeutic
alternatives
for
patients
with
low-grade
NHL
and
those
with
transformed
histology

CONCLUSION
:
The
treatment
paradigm
for
NHL
is
expected
to
change
over
the
next
few
years
to
include
radiolabeled
mAbs
,
administered
alone
or
in
combination
with
cytotoxic
agents

RESULTS
:
Clinical
trials
of
UFT
published
in
the
Western
world
have
included
581
patients
with
colorectal
cancer

The
activity
of
oral
UFT
in
large-bowel
cancer
when
administered
with
oral
LV
(
approximately
50
mg/dose
)
has
resulted
in
objective
response
rates
of
approximately
40
%

CONCLUSION
:
UFT
is
a
fluoropyrimidine
active
in
colorectal
cancer

BACKGROUND
:
Adrenalectomy
is
the
current
treatment
for
phaeochromocytoma

CONCLUSION
:
Adrenal-sparing
surgery
is
safe
and
effective
,
and
may
become
the
treatment
of
choice
in
patients
with
hereditary
phaeochromocytoma

<

PURPOSE
:
The
purposes
of
this
descriptive
,
longitudinal
study
were
to
evaluate
the
MacDibbs
Mouth
Assessment
instrument
for
the
assessment
of
mucositis
in
the
radiation
therapy
patient
being
treated
for
head
and

cancer
and
to
describe
the
course
of
radiation-induced

As
concomitant
thrombocytosis
persisted
despite
treatment
with
hydroxyurea
,
the
new

and
led
to
normalization
of
the
platelet
count
within
11
days

Background
:
Troglitazone
is
a

For
a
subset
of
patients
with
Kaposi
's
sarcoma
who
were
treated
with
recombinant
interferon
alfa-2a
,
the
disease
is
in
complete
remission
,
without
opportunistic
infection
,
and
they
appear
to
be
culture-negative
for
the
etiologic
retrovirus
that
causes
their
immune
deficiency

Interferon
alfa-2a
appears
to
have
antineoplastic
efficacy
,
(
and
may
have
antiretroviral
efficacy
as
well
)
in
this
epidemic
neoplasm

In
three
consecutive
Phase
II
trials
of
recombinant
interferon
alfa-2a
(
rIFN
alfa-2a
;
Roferon-A
Hoffmann-La
Roche
,
Nutley
,
NJ
)
involving
96
patients
with
advanced
malignant
melanoma
,
an
overall
response
rate
of
22
%
was
observed

As
single
agent
therapy
in
malignant
melanoma
,
interferon
alfa-2a
was
only
marginally
useful
in
most
patients

Studies
with
various
interferon
alpha
preparations
,
including
interferons
induced
in
human
leukocytes
,
interferon
alfa-N1
,
interferon
alfa-2a
,
and
interferon
alfa-2b
,
have
all
provided
evidence
for
modest
but
reproducible
antitumor
activity
in
advanced
renal
cell
carcinoma

Preliminary
evidence
suggests
that
interferons
beta
and
gamma
may
also
induce
regression
of
metastatic
renal
cell
carcinoma

The
rationale
for
antileukemic
therapy
in
hairy
cell
leukemia
is
to
reduce
the
significant
risk
of
infection
and
other
potential
serious
complications

Splenectomy
presumably
alleviates
the
pancytopenic
effect
of
hypersplenism
by
removing
the
preferred
site
of
leukemic
cell
proliferation

Recombinant
and
natural
forms
of
interferon
alpha
have
been
shown
to
bring
about
tumor
regressions
in
patients
with
low-grade
non-Hodgkin
's
lymphoma

Current
studies
using
interferon
in
patients
with
low-grade
non-Hodgkin
's
lymphomas
are
evaluating
lower
,
and
perhaps
better
tolerated
doses
of
interferon

This
approach
is
being
extended
to
the
clinic
,
and
trials
are
now
underway
evaluating
combinations
of
interferon
and
various
cytotoxic
drugs
known
from
previous
studies
to
be
active
in
patients
with
low-grade
non-Hodgkin
's
lymphomas

While
the
demonstrated
antiviral
,
antiproliferative
,
and
immunomodulatory
properties
of
interferons
have
led
to
a
number
of
theories
regarding
their
potential
use
in
treating
individuals
with
chronic
myelogenous
leukemia
(
CML
)
,
their
limited
availability
has
prevented
thorough
clinical
investigation

The
data
resulting
from
these
clinical
trials
indicate
that
interferon
alfa-2a
is
effective
in
inducing
hematologic
remissions
in
the
majority
of
minimally
treated
,
benign-phase
CML
,
Ph1-positive
patients

More
than
1600
patients
with
neoplastic
disorders
have
received
recombinant
human
interferon
alfa-2a
(
Roferon-A
,
Hoffmann-La
Roche
,
Nutley
,
NJ
)
as
part
of
ongoing
or
completed
clinical
trials

BACKGROUND
:
The
effectiveness
of
LTG
as
add-on
therapy
for
partial

has
previously
been

:
We

is
effective
and
well

when
administered
as

BACKGROUND
:
Omega3

The
present
study
was
performed
to
examine
whether

acids
also
exhibit
mood-stabilizing
properties
in
bipolar
disorder

CONCLUSION
:
Omega3
fatty
acids
were
well
tolerated
and
improved
the
short-term
course
of
illness
in
this
preliminary
study
of
patients
with
