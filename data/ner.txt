PROBLEM O
: O
To O

known O
as O

in O
conception O
versus O

even O

METHOD O
: O

was O
measured O
using O
an O
immunohistochemical O
method O
with O
a O
PIBF-specific O
polyclonal O

These O
levels O
were O
determined O
in O

three O
types O
of O

: O

RESULTS O
: O
PIBF O

detected O
in O
29.5 O

CONCLUSION O
: O
These O
data O
are O

with O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
maternal O
expression O
of O
PIBF O
in O
T-lymphocytes O
soon O

of O
why O

In O

, O
the O
neoplastic O
( O
BCR-ABL+ O

by O
an O

Whether O
these O

also O
resistant O
to O

and O
if O
so O
, O
under O
what O
conditions O
remains O
controversial O

We O
now O
show O
that O
highly O
purified O
populations O
of O
very O
primitive O
neoplastic O

cells O
obtained O
directly O
from O
CML O

survive O

In O

maintained O
under O
the O

conditions O

rapidly O

Nevertheless O
, O
both O
primary O
CML O
cells O
and O
BCR-ABL+ O
BAF3 O
cells O
show O
the O
same O
dose-dependent O
sensitivity O
to O
TNF-alpha O
or O
ceramide-induced O
apoptosis O
as O
their O
respective O
normal O
counterparts O

In O
fact O
, O
time O
course O
studies O
demonstrated O
an O
even O
faster O
onset O
of O
apoptosis O
in O
ceramide-treated O
BCR-ABL+ O
BAF3 O
cells O
as O
compared O
to O
normal O
controls O

BCR-ABL+ O
cells O
treated O
with O
ceramide O
also O
showed O
a O
rapid O
and O
sequential O
increase O
in O
the O
tyrosine O
phosphorylation O
of O
p210 O
( O
BCR-ABL O
) O
, O
p46-56SHC O
and O
p120Cbl O

These O
findings O
suggest O
growth O
factor O
deprivation O
and O
treatment O
with O
TNF-alpha O
or O
ceramide O
trigger O
different O
initial O
events O
both O
of O
which O
can O
lead O
to O
apoptosis O
in O
factor-dependent O
hematopoietic O
cells O

However O
, O
in O
the O
first O
case O
, O
activation O
of O
apoptosis O
is O
blocked O
by O
the O
basal O
activity O
of O
p210 O
( O
BCR-ABL O
) O
, O
whereas O
in O
the O
second O
, O
the O
presence O
of O
p210 O
( O
BCR-ABL O
) O
appears O
to O
accelerate O
the O
onset O
of O
apoptosis O
by O
a O
mechanism O
that O
may O
involve O
an O

Clinically O
, O
the O
hallmark O
of O
the O
human D
amnesic D
syndrome D
is O
an O
impaired O
ability O
to O
consciously O

daily O

If O
the O
medial O
region O
of O
the O

, O
including O
the O
hippocampus O
and O
related O

, O
is O
critical O
for O
establishing O
these O
new O
memories O
, O
then O
this O
brain O
region O
should O
be O
active O
whenever O
events O
are O
experienced O
, O
regardless O
of O
whether O
subjects O
are O
asked O
explicitly O
to O
learn O
and O

Here O
we O
show O
that O
the O
medial O
temporal O
region O
is O
active O
during O
encoding O
and O
that O
the O
hemisphere O
activated O
and O
the O
amount O
of O
activation O
depend O
on O
the O
type O
of O
stimulus O
presented O
( O

) O
, O
whether O
the O

can O
be O

, O
and O
task O
experience O
( O
first O
versus O
the O
second O
time O

) O

These O
findings O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
medial O
temporal O
lobe O
memory O
system O
is O
engaged O
automatically O
when O
we O
attend O
to O
a O
perceptual O
event O
and O
that O
the O
location O
and O
amount O
of O

depend O
on O

( O

The O

in O
the O
medial O

during O
the O

In O

In O

The O

Several O

providing O
a O

The O
current O

The O

that O

Other O

A O

The O

( O

suggest O
that O
CO2 O
modulates O
most O
of O
the O
reactions O
of O

biological O
systems O

The O
addition O
of O
peroxynitrite O

produces O
of O
the O
adduct O

( O

) O

The O
production O
of O
1 O
greatly O
accelerates O
the O
decomposition O

We O
now O
show O
that O
the O
formation O

is O
followed O
by O
reformation O

( O
rather O

To O

this O

it O
is O
necessary O

( O
When O

its O

although O

) O

We O
find O
that O
CO2 O
is O
a O
true O
catalyst O
of O
the O
decomposition O

peroxynitrite O
, O
and O
this O
fundamental O

must O
be O
rationalized O

any O
in O

that O
is O
proposed O

When O
the O
concentration O
of O
CO2 O
is O
lower O
than O
that O
of O
peroxynitrite O
, O
the O
reformation O
of O
CO2 O
amplifies O
the O
fraction O

with O
CO2 O

Even O
low O
concentrations O
of O
CO2 O
that O
result O
from O
the O
dissolution O
of O

CO2 O
can O
have O

RESULTS O
: O
The O

the O

the O
authors O
discuss O
the O
principal O
theories O
on O

They O
underline O
that O
it O

in O

the O
various O
genetic O

, O
endogenous O

mechanisms O
that O

the O

phenomenon O
multiple O

In O

they O
stress O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
senescence O
can O
be O
due O
to O
a O
sum O
of O
molecular O
damages O
caused O
by O
free O
radicals O
, O
and O
to O
the O
loss O

a O

the O

The O
somatic O

because O
during O
cell O
division O
, O
they O
lose O
the O
mechanisms O
for O
the O
lengthening O
of O
the O
telomere O

The O
telomerase O
prevents O
the O
shortening O
of O
telomeres O
in O
neoplastic O
cells O
and O
therefore O
renders O
them O
immortal O

Paradoxically O
the O

what O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Few O
studies O
have O
explored O
the O
health O
practices O
of O
critical O
care O
nurses O

Critical O
care O
nurses O
routinely O
teach O
patients O
about O
using O
healthy O
practices O
such O
as O
low-fat O
diets O
, O
exercise O
, O
and O
routine O
screening O
examinations O

However O
, O
it O
may O
be O
even O
more O
important O
that O
the O
nurses O
themselves O
have O
a O
healthy O
lifestyle O
, O
thus O
serving O
as O
role O
models O
for O
patients O

Nurses O
are O
selling O
a O
product O
, O
and O
that O
product O
is O
health O

The O
best O
salespersons O
are O
those O
who O
are O
genuinely O
committed O
to O
their O
product O
and O
model O
its O
benefits O

Therefore O
, O
critical O
care O
nurses O
' O
healthful O
practices O
can O
have O
a O
profound O
effect O
on O
their O
patients O

OBJECTIVES O
: O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
descriptive O
exploratory O
study O
was O
to O
examine O
critical O
care O
nurses O
' O
responses O
to O
three O
questions O
about O
health O
practices O
in O
their O
daily O
lives O
: O
( O

) O
What O
are O
critical O
care O
nurses O
doing O
currently O
to O
stay O
healthy O
? O
( O
2 O
) O
Do O
they O
anticipate O
making O
any O
changes O
in O
their O
lifestyle O
in O
the O
future O
? O
( O
3 O
) O
Would O
they O
recommend O
their O
lifestyle O
to O
their O
patients O
? O
METHODS O
: O
One O
hundred O
twenty-seven O
critical O
care O
nurses O
attending O
a O
midwestern O
critical O
care O
conference O
completed O
a O
two-part O
questionnaire O
designed O
to O
produce O
a O
health O
profile O

In O
a O
man-on-the-street O
approach O
, O
23 O
nurses O
participated O
in O
an O
interview O
via O
video O
camera O

Descriptive O
statistics O
were O
used O
to O
analyze O
the O
data O
retrieved O
from O
the O
questionnaires O

Interviews O
were O
transcribed O
verbatim O
and O
analyzed O
for O
themes O
with O
a O
constant O
comparative O
method O

RESULTS O
: O
More O
than O
70 O
% O
of O
the O
critical O
care O
nurses O
who O
responded O
engage O
in O
exercise O
and O
follow O
a O
healthy O
, O
low-fat O
diet O

Seventy-one O
percent O
said O
that O
they O
anticipate O
making O
a O
change O
in O
their O
lifestyle O
in O
the O
future O
, O
and O
70 O
% O
said O
that O
they O
would O
recommend O
their O
lifestyle O
to O
their O
patients O

Five O
themes O
emerged O
from O
the O
videotaped O
interviews O
: O
( O
1 O
) O
Heart-healthy O
practices O
predominated O
the O
responses O

( O
2 O
) O
Incorporating O
a O
healthy O
lifestyle O
was O
easy O
for O
some O
and O
a O
struggle O
for O
others O

( O
3 O
) O
Critical O
care O
nurses O
readily O
listed O
barriers O
to O
healthy O
living O

( O
4 O
) O
The O
nurses O
had O
a O
positive O
attitude O
about O
their O
healthy O
lifestyles O
and O
felt O
optimistic O
about O
being O
role O

) O
Future O
plans O
were O
either O
singular O
in O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
The O
majority O
of O
the O
nurses O
reported O
practicing O
a O
healthy O
lifestyle O
and O
thought O
that O
they O
were O

that O
focuses O
on O
preventive O
, O

It O
identifies O
the O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Darier D

is O
an O

A O

We O
report O
4 O

The O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Many O
of O
the O
clinical O
features O
of O
localized O
Darier D

suggest O
that O
it O
is O
a O
genetic O
mosaic O
of O
generalized O
Darier D
disease D

Further O

Although O

have O
recently O
been O

to O
photoreactivate O
both O

We O
describe O
the O

of O
two O
new O
classes O

, O
that O
are O
defective O
in O
the O
photoreactivation O
of O

, O
respectively O

We O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
CPD O
photolyase O
mutation O
is O
genetically O
linked O
to O
a O
DNA O
sequence O
encoding O
a O
type O
II O
( O
metazoan O

CPD O
photolyase O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
are O
able O
to O
generate O
plants O
in O
which O
only O
CPDs O
or O
6-4 O
products O
are O
photoreactivated O
in O
the O
nuclear O
genome O
by O
exposing O
these O

to O
UV O
light O
and O
then O
allowing O
them O
to O
repair O
one O
or O
the O
other O
class O

This O
provides O
us O
with O
a O
unique O
opportunity O
to O
study O
the O
biological O
consequences O
of O
each O
of O
these O
two O
major O

the O
five O

Dioxins O

in O
the O

Several O
dioxins O
are O
extremely O
stable O
compounds O
and O
persist O
for O
years O
in O
the O
environment O

Exposure O
to O
dioxins O
occurs O
mainly O
via O
the O
ingestion O
of O
contaminated O
food O

The O
lipophilic O
character O
of O
dioxins O
prevents O
their O
excretion O
in O
the O
urine O
and O
causes O
their O
accumulation O
in O
body O

The O
mechanisms O
of O
dioxin O
action O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
a O
hormone O

Dioxins O
bind O
to O
a O
specific O
intracellular O
receptor O
and O
the O
complex O
acts O
as O
a O
transcription O

that O

Certain O
dioxins O

, O
8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin O
, O
are O
very O
toxic O

to O
induce O
numerous O
clinical O
conditions O

The O
carcinogenicity O
of O
dioxins O
is O
well O
documented O
in O
animal O
models O
and O
has O
been O
described O
in O
humans O
after O
professional O
and O
accidental O
exposures O

Recent O
experimental O
data O
also O
indicate O
that O
dioxins O
can O
cause O
dysfunction D
of D
the D
sexual D
and D
thyroid D

systems D
and O
that O
the O
administration O
of O
dioxins O
induces O
several O
conditions O
related O
to O
hormonal D
dysfunction D

Chronic O
exposure O
of O
female O
Rhesus O

increases O
the O
incidence O

The O
administration O

causes O
altered O

the O
reproductive O
system O
, O
decreased O

development O
in O
the O

The O
particular O
sensibility O
of O
the O
fetus O

is O
of O
concern O
because O
the O
exposition O
to O
dioxins O
is O
particularly O
important O
during O
those O
periods O
of O

In O

The O
chronological O
parallelism O
with O
the O
appearance O

suggests O
that O
these O
might O
exert O

Sumatriptan T

These O

are O
very O

Fiercer O
competition O
between O
athletes O
and O
a O
wider O
knowledge O
of O
optimal O
training O
regimens O
dramatically O
influence O
current O
training O
methods O

A O
single O
training O
bout O
per O
day O
was O
previously O
considered O
sufficient O
, O
whereas O
today O
athletes O
regularly O
train O
twice O
a O
day O
or O
more O

Consequently O
, O
the O
number O
of O
athletes O
who O
are O
overtraining O
and O
have O
insufficient O
rest O
is O
increasing O

Positive O
overtraining O
can O
be O
regarded O
as O
a O
natural O
process O
when O
the O
end O
result O
is O
adaptation O
and O
improved O
performance O
: O
the O
supercompensation O
principle O
-- O
which O
includes O
the O
breakdown O
process O
( O
training O
) O
followed O
by O
the O
recovery O
process O
( O
rest O
) O
-- O
is O
well O
known O
in O
sports O

However O
, O
negative O
overtraining O
, O
causing O
maladaptation O
and O
other O
negative O
consequences O
such O
as O
staleness O
, O
can O
occur O

Physiological O
, O
psychological O
, O
biochemical O
and O
immunological O
symptoms O
must O
be O
considered O
, O
both O
independently O
and O
together O
, O
to O
fully O
understand O
the O
'staleness O
' O
syndrome O

However O
, O
psychological O
testing O
may O
reveal O
early-warning O
signs O
more O
readily O
than O
the O
various O
physiological O
or O
immunological O
markers O

The O
time O
frame O
of O
training O
and O
recovery O
is O
also O
important O
since O
the O
consequences O
of O
negative O
overtraining O
comprise O
an O
overtraining-response O
continuum O
from O
short O
to O
long O
term O
effects O

An O
athlete O
failing O
to O
recover O
within O
72 O
hours O
has O
presumably O
negatively O
overtrained O
and O
is O
in O
an O
overreached O
state O

For O
an O
elite O
athlete O
to O
refrain O
from O
training O
for O
> O
72 O
hours O
is O
extremely O
undesirable O
, O
highlighting O
the O
importance O
of O
a O
carefully O
monitored O
recovery O
process O

There O
are O
many O
methods O
used O
to O
measure O
the O
training O
process O
but O
few O
with O
which O
to O
match O
the O
recovery O
process O
against O
it O

One O
such O
framework O
for O
this O
is O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
total O
quality O
recovery O
( O
TQR O
) O
process O

By O
using O
a O
TQR O
scale O
, O
structured O
around O
the O
scale O
developed O
for O
ratings O
of O
perceived O
exertion O
( O
RPE O
) O
, O
the O
recovery O
process O
can O
be O
monitored O
and O
matched O
against O
the O
breakdown O
( O
training O
) O
process O
( O
TQR O
versus O
RPE O
) O

The O
TQR O
scale O
emphasises O
both O
the O
athlete O
's O
perception O
of O
recovery O
and O
the O
importance O
of O
active O
measures O
to O
improve O
the O
recovery O
process O

Furthermore O
, O
directing O
attention O
to O
psychophysiological O
cues O
serves O
the O
same O
purpose O
as O
in O
RPE O
, O
i.e O
. O
increasing O
self-awareness O

This O
article O
reviews O
and O
conceptualises O
the O
whole O
overtraining O
process O

In O
doing O
so O
, O
it O
( O

) O
aims O
to O
differentiate O
between O
the O
types O
of O

ability O
to O

: O
( O

) O
structures O
the O

The O
TQR O
method O
to O
facilitate O
monitoring O
of O
the O
recovery O
process O
is O
then O
suggested O
and O
a O
conceptual O
model O
that O
incorporates O
all O
of O
the O
important O
parameters O
for O
performance O
gain O
( O
adaptation O
) O
and O

( O
maladaptation O
) O

Little O
attention O
has O
been O
directed O
toward O
identifying O
the O
changes O
which O
occur O
in O
salivary O
composition O
in O
response O
to O
exercise O

To O
address O
this O
, O
our O
article O
first O
refers O
to O
the O
main O
aspects O
of O
salivary O
gland O
physiology O

A O
knowledge O
of O
the O
neural O
control O
of O
salivary O
secretion O
is O
especially O
important O
for O
the O
understanding O
of O
the O
effects O
of O
exertion O
on O
salivary O
secretion O

Both O
salivary O
output O
and O
composition O
depend O
on O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
autonomic O
nervous O
system O
and O
any O
modification O
of O
this O
activity O
can O
be O
observed O
indirectly O
by O
alternations O
in O
the O
salivary O
excretion O

The O
effects O
of O
physical O
activity O
( O
with O
reference O
to O
factors O
such O
as O
exercise O
intensity O
and O
duration O
, O
or O
type O
of O
exercise O
protocol O
) O
on O
salivary O
composition O
are O
then O
considered O

Exercise O
might O
indeed O
induce O
changes O
in O
several O
salivary O
components O
such O
as O
immunoglobulins O
, O
hormones O
, O
lactate O
, O
proteins O
and O
electrolytes O

Saliva O
composition O
might O
therefore O
be O
used O
as O
an O
alternative O
noninvasive O
indicator O
of O
the O
response O
of O
the O
different O
body O
tissues O
and O
systems O
to O
physical O
exertion O

In O
this O
respect O
, O
the O
response O
of O
salivary O
amylase O
and O
salivary O
electrolytes O
to O
incremental O
levels O
of O
exercise O
is O
of O
particular O
interest O

Beyond O
a O
certain O
intensity O
of O
exercise O
, O
and O
coinciding O
with O
the O
accumulation O
of O
blood O
lactate O
( O
anaerobic O
threshold O
or O
AT O
) O
, O
a O
'saliva O
threshold O
' O
( O
Tsa O
) O
does O
indeed O
exist O

Tsa O
is O
the O
point O
during O
exercise O
at O
which O
the O
levels O
of O
salivary O
alpha-amylase O
and O
electrolytes O
( O
especially O
Na+ O
) O
also O
begin O
to O
rise O
above O
baseline O
levels O

The O
occurrence O
of O
the O
2 O
thresholds O
( O
AT O
and O
Tsa O
) O
might O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
be O
attributable O
to O
the O
same O
underlying O
mechanism O
, O
that O
of O
increased O
adrenal O
sympathetic O
activity O
at O
high O
exercise O
intensities O

Fat O
is O
an O
extremely O
important O
substrate O
for O
muscle O
contraction O
, O
both O
at O
rest O
and O
during O
exercise O

Triglycerides O
( O
TGs O
) O
, O
stored O
in O
adipose O
tissue O
and O
within O
muscle O
fibres O
, O
are O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
main O
source O
of O
the O
free O
fatty O
acids O
( O
FFAs O
) O
oxidised O
during O
exercise O

It O
is O
still O
unclear O
, O
however O
, O
how O
the O
use O
of O
these O
substrates O
is O
regulated O
during O
exercise O

The O
regulation O
seems O
to O
be O
multifactorial O
and O
includes O
: O
( O
i O
) O
dietary O
and O
nutritional O
status O
; O
( O
ii O
) O
hormonal O
milieu O
; O
( O
iii O
) O
exercise O
mode O
, O
intensity O
and O
duration O
; O
and O
( O
iv O
) O
training O
status O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
mechanism O
for O
FFA O
transport O
from O
its O
storage O
as O
triglycerides O
in O
adipose O
tissue O
and O
muscle O
to O
its O
place O
of O
utilisation O
in O
heart O
, O
skeletal O
muscle O
, O
kidney O
and O
liver O
is O
more O
clearly O
understood O

It O
has O
been O
determined O
that O
the O
plasma O
FFA O
turnover O
rate O
is O
sufficiently O
rapid O
to O
account O
for O
most O
of O
the O
fat O
metabolised O
during O
low O
intensity O
exercise O
( O
25 O
to O
40 O
% O
VO2max O
) O

However O
, O
an O
exercise O
intensity O
of O
65 O
% O
VO2max O
results O
in O
a O
slight O
decrease O
in O
the O
amount O
of O
plasma O
FFA O
uptake O
by O
muscle O
tissue O

Other O
studies O
have O
found O
that O
during O
prolonged O
exercise O
, O
muscle O
TGs O
become O
the O
predominant O
source O
of O
energy O
obtained O
from O
fat O

Furthermore O
, O
it O
is O
widely O
documented O
that O
endurance O
activities O
increase O
the O
energy O
utilisation O
from O
fat O
while O
sparing O
carbohydrate O
sources O

For O
example O
, O
during O
exercise O
on O
a O
cycle O
ergometer O
, O
nonplasma O
FFAs O
and O
plasma O
FFAs O
contribute O

and O

, O
of O
the O
total O
calculated O
amount O
of O

before O
exercise O
and O
vice O

after O
exercise O
( O

and O

) O

Although O
it O
was O
many O
years O
before O
it O
was O
fully O
demonstrated O
, O
fat O
is O
now O
known O
to O
be O
transported O
in O
the O
blood O
as O
FFA O
bound O
to O
the O
protein O
carrier O
albumin O

The O
mobilisation O
of O
FFA O
is O
primarily O
a O
function O
of O
sympathetic O
nervous O
activity O
directed O
towards O
the O
adipocytes O
, O
or O
the O
'fat O
pad O
' O
. O
This O
nervous O
activity O
can O
be O
direct O
or O
may O
be O
an O
effect O
of O
circulating O
catecholamines O
such O
as O

PURPOSE O
: O
Inhaled O

, O
but O
they O
also O
cause O

, O
as O
